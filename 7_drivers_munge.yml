  # Calls the separate GCM download/munge pipeline which is built

  # This .ind file returns hashes for the files used in downstream processes
  # plus the PNG file that visualizes the cells & tiles used in the query.
  # Note that the resulting files are only accessible on Caldera. This is 
  # a brittle component, but is similar to how the NLDAS driver files are
  # disconnected from the rest of the pipeline. There is currently not an
  # easy way to connect Caldera & Google Drive, and the generated files are
  # not used downstream in this `lake-temperature-model-prep` pipeline, so 
  # we will continue to run this sub-pipeline separately
